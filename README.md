# Bayesian Updating for One-Dimensional Consolidation (Kelly & Huang, 2015)

This repository implements a **Bayesian back-analysis** of **one-dimensional consolidation** following the methodology of **Kelly & Huang (2015)**.  
It employs a Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (**DREAM**) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (**MCMC**) algorithm to update geotechnical parameters governing settlement over time.

## üß© Overview

The program performs parameter inference for a 1D consolidation problem, progressively updating estimates of:
- **m_v** ‚Äî coefficient of volume compressibility (1/kPa)  
- **H** ‚Äî drainage path length (m)  
- **Œ≥_f** ‚Äî fill unit weight (kN/m¬≥)  
- **c_v** ‚Äî coefficient of consolidation (m¬≤/year)

Given observed settlement data, the DREAM MCMC sampler explores the posterior distributions of these parameters, updating their estimates as additional field observations become available.

Two variants are included:
1. **example_consolidation.py** ‚Äî baseline Bayesian updating for the full dataset.  
2. **progressive_DREAM.py** ‚Äî progressive assimilation experiment, updating posteriors sequentially with each new observation.
